### Questions

### How to encrypt using Chinese Code cipher?
Encryption with chinese code uses the positions (ranks) of vowels and consonants in the alphabet. In the original chinese code cipher, the horizontal bars represent the vowels : A (1 bar), E (2 bars), I (3 bars), O (4 bars), U (5 bars), Y (6 bars) and vertical bars represent the number of consonants that follow the vowel in the alphabet. Example: To code C, which is the 2nd consonant following the vowel A, use 1 horizontal bar (A is the first vowel) and 2 vertical bars.To code L, which is the 3rd consonant following the vowel I, use 3 horizontal bars (I is the 3rd vowel) and 3 vertical bars. Example: DCODE is written  The full original alphabet used is:  There exists a variation which inverts the vertical and horizontal bars (also called the Samurai alphabet)

### How to decrypt Chinese Code cipher?
Count the number of horizontal and vertical lines. The number of horizontal lines represent the vowels: A, E, I, O, U, Y then the number of vertical lines is used for the number of consonants following the vowel. The Samurai variant swap the vertical and horizontal lines.

### How to recognize Chinese Code ciphertext?

### What are the variants of the Chinese Code cipher?
