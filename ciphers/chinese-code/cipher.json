            "answer": "Encryption with chinese code uses the positions (ranks) of vowels and consonants in the alphabet. In the original chinese code cipher, the horizontal bars represent the vowels : A (1 bar), E (2 bars), I (3 bars), O (4 bars), U (5 bars), Y (6 bars) and vertical bars represent the number of consonants that follow the vowel in the alphabet. Example: To code C, which is the 2nd consonant following the vowel A, use 1 horizontal bar (A is the first vowel) and 2 vertical bars.To code L, which is the 3rd consonant following the vowel I, use 3 horizontal bars (I is the 3rd vowel) and 3 vertical bars. Example: DCODE is written  The full original alphabet used is:  There exists a variation which inverts the vertical and horizontal bars (also called the Samurai alphabet)",
