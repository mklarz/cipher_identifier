The message takes the form of 86 characters (with 24 distinct characters) written on 3 lines: dorabella.png\" loading=\"lazy\" /> The 24 characters and their distribution (based on frequency analysis) are compatible with encryption by mono-alphabetical substitution. Edward Elgar never disclosed the original message but would have described his alphabet and substitution table as follows: LetterSymbolLetterSymbolLetterSymbolABCDEFGHI/JKLMNOPQRSTU/VWXYZ allowing the translation of the message into BPECAHTCKYFRQDRIRRHPPRDXYXGFSTRTHTCKLCERREHGQTRFRHUSQDXKKXFSESHUSEDUWGSERHUQSDCPGSHCDXC Other alphabets have been proposed but this message has never been clearly decrypted even if several people have tried various translations, none has convinced the community. The presence of a dot near the end of the first line is sometimes considered to be an 87th character (and therefore 25 distinct)",
