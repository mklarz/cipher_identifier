            "answer": "The Ogham/Ogam language uses an alphabet composed mainly of 20 basic symbols corresponding to certain letters of the classical Latin alphabet. There are sometimes other rare symbols that appear in manuscripts that are combinations of letters. The encryption is performed by a replacement of the Ogham symbols by 20 letters of the alphabet. Example: CELT is written  horizontally or vertically : dCode replaces the missing Latin letters with others: J=>I, K=>Q, P=>NG, V=>U, W=>U, X=>Z. Some Oghamic writing have been written from top to bottom and not from bottom to top. ",
