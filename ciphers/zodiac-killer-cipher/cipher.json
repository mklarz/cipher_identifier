It is these 4 cryptograms (called Z408, Z340, Z32 and Z13 depending on their length) made up of symbols that contributed to the mysterious reputation of the killer. To date, only the first cryptogram Z408 has been resolved. The second cryptogram Z340 is still the subject of speculation, like Z13 and Z32.",
